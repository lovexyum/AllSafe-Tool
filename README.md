# AllSafe-Tool
A very basic python-based antimalware tool. It can check files and links for any malicious activity based on trusted malware databases and VirusTotal.

TUTORIAL:
1. Make sure you have Python Installed with ALL dependencies
2. In your command prompt, run the following command: pip install requests watchdog plyer
3. Now to actually make it work, open it in any code editor and find your VirusTotal API Key. You can find this by making a Virus Total account and going to your settings.
4. Save the updated file, and run the following command to run it: python allsafetool.py
5. Enter any URL's or files to the scanner to detect malicious activity, or do a scan to check out your computer for any malware!
